# Generic-Drugs-Supply-Portal
The project aims to establish an online platform for the buying and selling of generic medicines at reduced costs.
The primary objective of this initiative is to reduce medical expenses for individuals while maintaining and even
enhancing overall health outcomes. It's important to note that the primary advantage of generic medicines is not
solely about cost-savings but, more importantly, the improvement of health and well-being.

Currently, there is a notable absence of a computerized system that facilitates the sale of generic medicines.
Patients, in search of affordable medication, often resort to physically visiting the nearest generic medical store.
This traditional approach has limitations, including a lack of access to alternatives to the medicine prescribed by a doctor.

This project aims to address these issues by creating an online marketplace for generic medicines, making it more convenient
for patients to access affordable medications and explore a wider range of generic alternatives, thereby promoting both 
cost-efficiency and better health outcomes.
